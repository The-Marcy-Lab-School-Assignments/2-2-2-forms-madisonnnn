# Question
Why do you need labels for every input? What are the two ways to associate a label with an input?

# Answer
You need labels for every input so the user and developer knows the context of the information and they are associated through the 'for' attribute and ids.

# Teacher Feedback

You are just missing one way to associate the label with the input and it is through nesting!
