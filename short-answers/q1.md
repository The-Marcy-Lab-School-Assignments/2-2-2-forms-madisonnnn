# Question
Say I have a form on a page with an input for a user's email and password. When you click the submit button, suddenly the url goes from:

```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/
```
to this:
```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/?email=tom%40gmail.com&password=123456
```

The whole page refreshed as well. Why did that happen, and how can we stop it?

# Answer
The user interaction with an input element when the html and information has nowhere to go it refreshes the page and the data becomes reflected in the website url. To avoid this, you can create an event handler that responds to the users input.

# Teacher Feedback

What is described above, in the question is the default behavior of a form being submitted, you are correct that we can create an event handler to handle the submit however, you forgot to mention that we would have to use the event method preventDefault to stop the default behavior!
