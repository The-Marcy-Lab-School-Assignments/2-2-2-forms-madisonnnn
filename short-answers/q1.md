# Question
Say I have a form on a page with an input for a user's email and password. When you click the submit button, suddenly the url goes from:

```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/
```
to this:
```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/?email=tom%40gmail.com&password=123456
```

The whole page refreshed as well. Why did that happen, and how can we stop it?

# Answer
The user interaction with an input element when the html and information has nowhere to go it refreshes the page and the data becomes reflected in the website url. To avoid this, you can create an event handler that responds to the users input. A better way to do this is to use preventDefault, since this is the default behavior of submitting a form.

You got it! Important reminder that the submit event goes on the form not on the button or inputs!
